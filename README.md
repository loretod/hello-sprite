# Hello Sprite
This 2 Minute Arcade tutorial will walk you through some of the most often used blocks when adding a sprite to your game.

##Predict :crystal ball:
Take a look at the code and make a prediction on what you think this code does?

##Run :person running:
See if you were correct? Press the **A**. Was you're prediction correct?

##Investigate :magnifying glass tilted right:
Now... let's see what happens if you put the ''||sprites.create||'' at the bottom of the blocks?

##Modify :red triangle pointed up:
Time to change some things around. Play around with the some of the settings and see what happens.
-[] Click on the ''cat'' image and draw your own or select a different one from the library.
-[] Change the x and y numbers in the velocity block.
-[] Change the x and y numbers in the sprite position block.
-[] Turn off the bounce off the wall option.
-[] Turn off the stay on screen option.

##Make :brain:
Now it's your turn! From the ''Controller'' menu, drag the "||controller.onA||" block and change it to **B**.

Load a second sprite on the screen using your desired settings.

Press **B** to run your code.

##Recap :recycling symbol:
In this 2 Minute Arcade, we learned about how to load a sprite onto the game and adjust some of it's properties.

We also learned that it's pretty important to create the sprite variable ***first*** before beginning to change properties.

Nice!
